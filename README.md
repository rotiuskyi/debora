# Debora

Elixir/Phoenix (backend) and React (frontend) application.

## React

React app stuff placed to `webui` directory. To get started developing you have to:
- install `docker` and `compose` plugin
- add environment variables using one of the template file from `./env/` directory (copy, rename, set missing variables)
- read env variables e.g. (use `Bash` or `Git Bash` on Windows)
```
source env/.env.dev
```
- start services
```
docker compose up -d
```
- for older versions
```
docker-compose up -d
```
